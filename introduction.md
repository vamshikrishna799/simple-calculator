Simple Calculator Documentation
Overview:
The Simple Calculator program is a Java application that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation. It provides a menu-driven interface where users can select the desired operation, input two numbers, and obtain the result.

Features:
Menu-driven Interface: Users are presented with a menu of operation choices, and they can select an option based on their requirement.

Arithmetic Operations: The calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.

Looping Structure: The program utilizes a while loop to continuously prompt the user for input until they choose to quit.

Error Handling: If the user enters an invalid operator choice, the program displays an error message and prompts the user to choose again.

How it Works:
Initialization: The program starts by initializing a Scanner object to read user input from the console.

Menu Display and Input: It then enters a while loop where it displays the menu of operations and prompts the user to choose an operator. The user inputs their choice, and if it is '6', indicating they want to quit, the program exits the loop.

Input Numbers: If the user does not choose to quit, the program prompts the user to enter two numbers for the selected operation.

Operation Execution: Based on the selected operator, the program performs the corresponding arithmetic operation on the input numbers and stores the result.

Display Result: It then prints the result of the operation to the console.

Repeat or Quit: The program continues looping, allowing the user to perform more calculations, until they choose to quit by entering '6'.

Closing Resources: Finally, the Scanner object is closed to release system resources.

Execution Example:

User Interaction:
The user is presented with a menu of operation choices.
They select an operation by entering the corresponding number.
They input two numbers for the selected operation.
The result of the operation is displayed.
They can choose to perform another calculation or exit the program.
Conclusion:
The Simple Calculator program provides a basic yet functional tool for performing arithmetic calculations. Its user-friendly interface and error handling make it suitable for simple mathematical tasks. The modular structure of the code allows for easy maintenance and future enhancements.

}
**Features:**
Menu-Driven Interface: Users are presented with a menu displaying operation choices.
Arithmetic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.
Error Handling: Displays an error message for invalid operator choices.
Looping Structure: Utilizes a while loop to continuously prompt the user for input until they choose to quit.
Resource Management: Closes the Scanner object to release system resources after execution.
**Code Explanation:**
The program begins by initializing a Scanner object to read input from the console. It then enters a while loop to continuously prompt the user for input until they choose to quit by entering '6'.

Within each iteration of the loop:

The menu of operation choices is displayed.
The user selects an operation by entering the corresponding number.
If the user chooses to quit, the program exits the loop and displays a farewell message.
Otherwise, the program prompts the user to input two numbers for the selected operation.
Based on the chosen operator, the program performs the corresponding arithmetic operation and stores the result.
If the chosen operator is invalid, an error message is displayed, and the user is prompted to choose again.
Finally, the result of the operation is displayed to the user.
After the loop ends, the Scanner object is closed to release system resources.
